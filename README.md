### Ex. 1 - Playing with Shapes and Patterns
- A pattern of lines isolated within a circular perimeter.
- Practicing the use of `TWO_PI` - based on P5.js docs.

### Ex. 2 - Trigonometry
- Practicing the use of Inverse Tan (i.e. Tan-^1)
- P5.js version = atan()

### Ex. 2.5 - Trigonometry Continued
- Continuing on from Ex. 2, but instead of all squares rotating in the same direction, each squares rotates individually depending on where the mouse cursor is. 

### Ex. 2.75 - Trigonometry Advanced
- Using Ex. 2.5, each circles has smaller circles in them to display the `atan2()` function.
- Calculating the scale value is also demonstrated within this exercise. 

### Ex. 3 - Controlled-Randomised Pattern
- A pattern of controlled-randomised objects demonstrating ordered-random.
- Includes a bespoke animation loop that displays a "pulsating" colour effect.
- Courtesy to Eoan O Dea for helping out with the "pulsating" colour animation loop.
